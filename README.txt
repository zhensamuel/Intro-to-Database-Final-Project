The database is used in tandem with PhpMyAdmin and XAMPP to host the server and allow the database to communicate with host/web-app. Here contains all the necessary files for the DB, UI/Web, as well as any css/styling in the assets folder. Queries were originally written in postgres but needed to be rewritten in MySQL in order to work properly with PhpMyAdmin. There is a config.php which establishes a connection with DB and the website. Website is barebones only having the necessary functions and features of a SIMS. SQL files here are separated one for each: Creation of tables, Insertion of data, and the SQL queries. Thank you for your time and looking into our project!
